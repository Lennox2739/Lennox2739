            Both stations can transmit but not at the same time. When one device is sending the other can Only
            receive but not at the same time.

            Both stations can transmit and receive simulataneously. Here, signals going in one direction, share 
            link capacity with signals going the direction. Sharing can occur in two ways. Either the link must
            contain two for sending and another for receiving/capacity of the channel is divided into signals 
            travelling in both directions.
